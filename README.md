<p>&emsp; This is the first portfolio project in Codecademy's Data Scientist path. THe goal is to import data from a .csv and manipulate it in various ways.</p></br>
<p>&emsp; After the Python courses in the skillpath I managed to import the data and write functions to explore it and arrive at conclusions.</p></br>
<p>&emsp; Further in the path I will learn tools to aid visualization and do more interesting things :)</p></br>
