Coursework for Codecademy Data Scientist path

2023.06.23
  This is the first portfolio project in Codecademy's Data Scientist path. THe goal is to import data from a .csv and manipulate it in various ways.
  After the Python courses in the skillpath I managed to import the data and write functions to explore it and arrive at conclusions.
  Further in the path I will learn tools to aid visualization and do more interesting things :)
